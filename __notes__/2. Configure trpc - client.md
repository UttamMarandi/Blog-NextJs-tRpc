### 1

We need to createReactQueryHooks from @trpc/react and export it with the generic
type that we will receive from the backend trpc implementation.

```
// src/utils/trpc.ts


import { createReactQueryHooks } from '@trpc/react'

// todo add appRouter as generic type for createReactQueryHooks

export const trpc = createReactQueryHooks()

```

### 2

Now in our app component in react/next we need to export the app with withTRPC as HOC.

### withTRPC()

withTRPC is an HOC that configures the react app and the tRPC server.

#### options

##### config()

The config-argument is a function that returns an object that configures the tRPC and React Query clients. This function has a ctx input that gives you access to the Next.js req object, among other things

###### options

Required:
links : To customize the flow of data between tRPC Client and the tRPC Server.

Optional:
queryClientConfig: a configuration object for the React Query QueryClient used internally by the tRPC React hooks

queryClient: a React Query QueryClient instance
Note: You can only provide either a queryClient or a queryClientConfig.

transformer: a transformer applied to outgoing payloads.

abortOnUnmount: determines if in-flight requests will be cancelled on component unmount. This defaults to false.

##### ssr

Whether tRPC should await queries when server-side rendering a page. Defaults to false.

##### responseMeta

Ability to set request headers and HTTP status when server-side rendering.

```
export default withTRPC<AppRouter>({
  config({ ctx }) {
    /* [...] */
  },
  ssr: true,
  responseMeta({ clientErrors, ctx }) {
    if (clientErrors.length) {
      // propagate first http error from API calls
      return {
        status: clientErrors[0].data?.httpStatus ?? 500,
      };
    }
    // cache full page for 1 day + revalidate once every second
    const ONE_DAY_IN_SECONDS = 60 * 60 * 24;
    return {
      'Cache-Control': `s-maxage=1, stale-while-revalidate=${ONE_DAY_IN_SECONDS}`,
    };
  },
})(MyApp);

```

### Minimal Implementation

```
// src/pages/__apt.tsx

import "../styles/globals.css";
import type { AppProps } from "next/app";
import { withTRPC } from "@trpc/next";

export const baseUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_URL
  ? `https://${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_URL}`
  : "http://localhost:3000";

export const url = `${baseUrl}/api/trpc`;

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />;
}

export default withTRPC<AppRouter>({
  config({ ctx }) {
    // config is the function that will configure trpc on client side
    // with given settings
    // for config() we can return url and it will work. This is the minimum.
    return {
      url
    };
  },
})(MyApp);

```

### Optimized Implementation

#### Links

Links enable you to customize the flow of data between the tRPC Client and Server. A link should do only one thing, which can be either a self-contained modification to a tRPC operation (query, mutation, or subscription) or a side-effect based on the operation (such as logging).

You can compose links together into an array that you can provide to the tRPC client configuration via the links property, which represents a link chain. This means that the tRPC client will execute the links in the order they are added to the links array when doing a request and will execute them again in reverse when it's handling a response.

#### loggerLink()

loggerLink is a link that lets you implement a logger for your tRPC client. It allows you to see more clearly what operations are queries, mutations, or subscriptions, their requests, and responses. The link, by default, prints a prettified log to the browser's console.

#### httpBatchLink()

httpBatchLink is a terminating link that batches an array of individual tRPC operations into a single HTTP request that's sent to a single tRPC procedure.

httpBatchLink is the recommended terminating link by tRPC.
httpLink and wsLink are other examples of terminating links.

The httpBatchLink function takes an options object which where url prop is mandatory.

##### Other Options

1. maxBatchSize => This limits the number of requests that can be sent together in batch ( useful to prevent the url from getting too large and run into HTTP error 413 ).

#### superJson

SuperJSON allows us to transparently use, e.g., standard Date/Map/Sets over the wire between the server and client. That is, you can return any of these types from your API-resolver and use them in the client without having to recreate the objects from JSON.

#### Full Code

```
import "../styles/globals.css";
import type { AppProps } from "next/app";
import { withTRPC } from "@trpc/next";
import { loggerLink } from "@trpc/client/links/loggerLink";
import { httpBatchLink } from "@trpc/client/links/httpBatchLink";
import superjson from "superjson";
import { AppRouter } from "../server/route/app.router";

export const baseUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_URL
  ? `https://${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_URL}`
  : "http://localhost:3000";

export const url = `${baseUrl}/api/trpc`;

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />;
}

export default withTRPC<AppRouter>({
  config({ ctx }) {
    // config is the function that will configure trpc on client side
    // with given settings
    // for config() we can return url and it will work. This is the minimum.

    // return {
    //   url,
    // };
    const links = [
      // order of links is important
      loggerLink(),
      httpBatchLink({
        maxBatchSize: 10,
        url,
      }),
    ];

    return {
      queryClientConfig: {
        defaultOptions: {
          queries: {
            staleTime: 60,
            // The time in milliseconds after data is considered stale.
            // If set to Infinity, the data will never be considered stale.
            // defaultOptions are for React-Query
          },
        },
      },
      headers() {
        if (ctx?.req) {
          return {
            ...ctx.req.headers,
            "x-ssr": "1", // this means that the request is done on the server
          };
        }
        return {};
      },
      links,
      transformer: superjson,
    };
  },
  ssr: false,
})(MyApp);

```
